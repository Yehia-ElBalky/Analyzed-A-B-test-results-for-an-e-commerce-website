# Analyzed-A-B-test-results-for-an-e-commerce-website

For this project, I worked on analyzing the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company understand if they should:
Implement the new webpage,
Keep the old webpage, or
Run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The project's notebook is organized into the following sections:
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression
